# NHL Tracker

This is a prototype for an NHL live tracker which is woefully unusable at the time of writing
due to league-wide shutdown. It consists of two layouts - one that displays the active NHL games,
location and current score, and an expanded view which can then reveal data layers for types of shot and shot by player 
which looks like this:

In all honesty, this was built as a way to familiarize myself with Vue and Nuxt - if I were to re-do this today my approach would be significantly different, but if this is interesting to you, knock yourself out.
